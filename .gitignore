# The .gitignore file tells git which files to ignore

# This is helpful because some files can change frequently, but
# do not represent meaningful changes to our repository

# Lines starting with a hash are comments

# Ignore all files ending with .pdf
*.pdf

# Ignore files generated by LaTeX compilation
*.aux
*.log
*.bbl
*.blg
